It creates two outputs: a distribution of predictive power associated to each DEG and a Binary Matrix of predicted class labels.\n}\n\\usage{\nPredictive_Power(X, y, intercept = TRUE, pp_thr, q_thr)\n}\n%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.\n\\arguments{\n\n  \\item{X}{Matrix containing predictors values.}\n  \\item{y}{True classification vector.}\n  \\item{intercept}{Logical.
